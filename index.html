									<h2 class="major">Quick Summary</h2>
									<p>After graduating from Spelman College in Atlanta, GA with a B.A. in Sociology, I started my post-graduate career serving in AmeriCorps at a residential psychiatric treatment facility and school for youth with severe emotional and behavioral issues. During my service term, I rediscovered my childhood affinity for technology and redirected my career to software development following my time in AmeriCorps.</p>
									<p>I completed a full stack coding bootcamp focused primarily on C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and spent multiple years teaching and developing curriculum for software development.</p>
									<p><strong>So, what's next?</strong> I'm ready to begin the next pivot of my career from educating others as my primary contribution to helping people solve problems by delivering software in an agile environment.</p>

									<p>The Buckeye MazeSweeper project is a project-based cross-platform hybrid mobile application project focused on teaching JavaScript. The goal of the game is to find the correct path through the maze without losing all of your buckeyes. Buckeyes function as lives, so the game ends when you run out of lives. I designed and developed this application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Cordova-based technologies.</p>
